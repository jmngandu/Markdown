  when pages are too large we need to hide some parts, so we use "details" tag then "summary" tag to show the part to be clicked
  The hidden content is displayed after the closing tag 
  for example:
  <details>
          <summary>Click </summary>
          
            ##My accounts

            * linkedin 
            * github
        </details>

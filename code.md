To display code we normally use :
INLINE CODE
for example const name = `James ngandu`

CODE BLOCK
To indicate a block of code 
  for example 
       ```
        const name = 'James ngandu';
        
        console.log(name);
        ```
CODE HIGHLIGHTING
This makes a code more clear by using colors, we introduce ts after the three   
      ```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

CODE DIFF
This shows a difference between a line of code, we usually use negative sign(-) or positive sign (+)

    
        ```diff
        - const firstname = 'James';
        + const firstname = 'Ngandu';
        const lastname = 'mukuvi';
        
        console.log(firstname, lastname);
        ```
